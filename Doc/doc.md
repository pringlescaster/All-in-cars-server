SMTP_PORT=587 means This specifies the port used for the SMTP connection. 587 is the standard port for STARTTLS, a security protocol that encrypts communication between your application and the mail server.

STARTTLS is a protocol command used to initiate encryption for an email connection. It stands for "Start Transport Layer Security" and allows a connection that starts as plaintext to be upgraded to a secure, encrypted connection using TLS (Transport Layer Security).
